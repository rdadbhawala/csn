# CSN : Comma Separated Notation

This document is the specification for Comma Separated Notation.

## Introduction

The Comma Separated Notation (CSN) is a format for exchanging structured data between systems. The notation is strongly influenced by the Comma Separated Values (CSV) format but the specification adds enhancements to support multiple types, instances, arrays and references. CSN is also optimized for size, generation and parsing especially for larger data sets.

### Versioning

The CSN Specification will follow the Semantic Versioning 2.0.0 system. Typically, Patch numbers will address errors in the specification, Minor numbers will add non-breaking functionality while Major numbers will represent large changes to the feature set.

The version of this specification is **0.1.0**. It is still in beta.

### Reference Documents

* CSV RFC 4180: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180
* Swagger Specification: https://swagger.io/specification/
* ABNF RFC 2234: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2234

## Specification

This section explains how data is structured/ organized in the CSN format. It follows a top-down approach, as it will introduce the larger concepts first, and then go on to the smaller ones.

### Payload

**Payload is a set of Records.**

Payload is the complete data set that is being exchanged between two systems. Information in a Payload is arranged and structured according to the rules and conventions defined in this document. 

All information is organized into records. Following are the types of records:
* Version Record
* Type Definition (TypeDef) Record
* Array Record
* Instance Record

Rules:
* Consecutive records must be separated by the 'line feed' (\n) character.
* Last record must not end with the 'line feed' character.
* The first record must be a Version record.
* Second record onwards, there can be 
  * Zero or more TypeDef records,
  * Zero or more Array records, and
  * Zero or more Instance records.

Eg: A sample Payload containing a Type, 2 Instances, and an Array of the 2 Instances.
```
V0,'1.0.0'
T1,'Person','FirstName','LastName'
I2,T1,'1','1'
I3,T1,'2','2'
A4,T1,#2,#3
```

### Record

**A Record is a set of Fields.**

A Record is a single logical unit of data. It consist of a set of values, with each value recorded in individual Fields.

Eg:
```
Field,Field,Field
```

Rules:
* Fields of a Record are separated by the 'comma' (,) character.
* All 'TypeDef' records must the defined before they are used in an other Array or Instance Records.
* The first two fields of each record are special as they provide more meaningful information about the record.
  * The first field indicates the type of that record. This field is called the Record Code. It consists of an alphabetic code followed by a Sequence Number.
  * The second field contains information specific to the record itself. More information about this field will be specified with each record type.

#### Version Record

**A Version Record specifies which CSN Standard this document adheres to.**

The Version Record is the metadata about the Payload.

Eg:
```
V0,'1.0.0'
```

Rules:
* A Version Record is the first record of the Payload.
* There can be only one Version record in a Payload.
* A Version Record contains exactly 2 fields.
  * The first field, which is the Record Code, is always "V0".
  * The second field states the version of the CSN specification.

#### TypeDef Record

**A TypeDef Record is a template which lists its labels for the Fields in an Instance Record of that type.**


Eg:
```
V0,'1.0.0'
T1,'Person','FirstName','LastName'
```

Rules:
* The first field of a TypeDef record must begin with the character 'T' immediately followed by the 'Sequence Number'. (Sequence numbers are explained later in this document).
* The second field specifies a name for this TypeDef. This helps in assigning a logical, readable label to the TypeDef Record.
* Members of the Type are listed from the third field onwards.
* The Type name (second field) as well its members (remaining fields) are of the type 'string'.

#### Instance Record

**An Instance Record is an actual data record containing relevant and important values.**

Eg:
```
V0,'1.0.0'
T1,'Person','FirstName','LastName'
I2,T1,'1','1'
I3,T1,'2','2'
```
Rules:
* The first field of an Instance Record must begin with the character 'I' immediately followed by the 'Sequence Number'.
* The second field is the Record Code of the TypeDef that the record adheres to.
* The data that is part of this record begins third field onwards. These fields are referred to as the "Data Fields" of an Instance.
* The sequence of data fields must be as per the sequence of members in the corresponding TypeDef record. Effectively, an Instance has the same number of fields as its TypeDef.

#### Array Record

**An Array Record is a set of values of the same type.**

Rules:
* The first field of an Array record must begin with the character 'A' immediately followed by the 'Sequence Number'.
* The second field points to the "Type" of elements in the array.
* Third field onwards are actual values, which are elements of the array.
* If it is an Array of Primitive Types (explained later in this document), the values are given directly in the record.
* If it is an Array of Instances of TypeDef Record, the values are expressed as reference to Instances.
* There is no limit on the number of fields in an Array Instance.

Eg: A4 is an array of Instances, A5 is an Array of Integers.
```
V0,'1.0.0'
T1,'Person','FirstName','LastName'
I2,T1,'1','1'
I3,T1,'2','2'
A4,T1,#2,#3
A5,PI,100,200
```

### Record Codes

**As described above, a Record Code is a unique identifier for the Record and its Type.**

It consists of 2 parts:
* An alphabetic code which identifies the type of record.
* A Sequence Number, which is a unique identifier.

#### Alphabetic Codes

**The alphabetic codes reveal the type of record.**

Particularly in implementation, the Alphabetic Code will aid in setting up parsers for efficient execution.

Following are the allowed alphabetic codes:
| Alphabet | Description |
| --- | --- |
| V | Version |
| T | TypeDef |
| A | Array |
| I | Instance |
| P | Primitive Types |

#### Sequence Number

**Sequence Number is a numbering system used in CSN to create unique identifiers for each record within a Payload.**

It is an incrementing integer, starting with 0. Since the first record of a Payload is always the Version record, its Record Code is always 'V0'.

Rules:
* Sequence Numbers are integers.
* Sequence Numbers start with 0, then increment by 1 for each successive record.
* Since the first record is always a Version Record, its Sequence Number is always '0', and hence its Record Code is always 'V0'.

Eg:
```
V0,'1.0.0'
T1,'Person','FirstName','LastName'
I2,T1,'1','1'
I3,T1,'2','2'
A4,T1,#2,#3
```

### Field

**A Field is a single, atomic unit of information.**

Fields store individual values. A Field is the smallest unit of data/ information in a Payload.

A Field can contain 2 types of values:
* a data value expressed as one of the primitive types, OR
* a reference to another Record (any of Instance, TypeDef or Array).

Eg:
```
V0,'1.0.0'
T1,'Person','FirstName','LastName'
I2,T1,'1','1'
I3,T1,'2','2'
A4,T1,#2,#3
```

Rules
* Fields can not contain a 'comma' or a 'new line' character, except for the data types such as string where such characters can be 'escaped'.
* Additional rules for Primitive Types and References are given in the following section.

#### Primitive Types

The supported Primitive Types are:
* String
* Boolean
* (Real) Number
* (Long) Integer
* DateTime

##### String

**A String Type can store any literal value that is supported by the character set.**

Rules:
* String values must always be enclosed in Single Quotes (').
* Within the single quotes, a string field can contain the comma and the new line characters, which don't affect the Payload Structure.
* String values can contain the following characters in an escaped manner:

| Character | Escape |
| --- | --- |
| `'` (single quote) | `\'` | 
| `\` (back slash) | `\\` |

##### Boolean

**A Boolean type reflects a True or a False value.**

Rules:
* A 'true' value is indicated with the character 'Y' (without the quotes).
* A 'false' value is indicated with the character 'N' (without the quotes).

##### Floating Point Number

**A Floating Point Number can represent any numerical value.**

Rules:
* Use a period (.) for a decimal separator.
* No thousand separators.
* Use hyphen/ minus character for negative numbers.
* Exponentiation formats are not yet supported.


##### Integer

**An Integer represents numbers without fractions.**

Rules:
* Integer doesn't use a decimal or a thousand separator.
* Use hyphen/ minus character for negative numbers.

##### DateTime

**A DateTime value represents a date and time.**

Rules:
* Timestamp values must start with the character 'D'.
* This must be followed by a date and time value in the ISO 8601 Format.
* The date and time must be expressed in the 'basic' format expressed as 'YYYYMMDDThhmmss.sssÂ±hhmm' for localized time, or as 'YYYYMMDDThhmmss.sssZ' for UTC time.

#### Reference

**References are pointers to other records in the Payload.**

References can reduce redundancy in the Payload.

Rules:

* Reference values start with the '#' character.
* This is immediately followed by the Sequence Number of the target record which is being referenced.

## ABNF Notation:

```
Payload = VersionRecord *(LF NonVersionRecord)

VersionRecord = VersionRecordCode FieldSep VersionString
FieldSep = ","
VersionRecordCode = "V0"
VersionString = "'1.0.0'"

NonVersionRecord = (TypeDef / Array / Instance)
```
